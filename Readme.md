# Testing
Open the file (in your browser, not VS Code) labeled `SpecRunner.html` to run the test suite. 
Some tests will be created for you, but it is HIGHLY encouraged that you write your own too.
To add your own tests, open the file in `tests/problems.test.js` and find the `describe` block 
matching the current toy problem. Add your new tests there. This is a great opportunity to practice
TDD and mocha/chai!
